## Submissions

Elyssa Emrich - elyssa@elastic.co. Our team is happy to give a talk on the Elastic Stack for the Dec. 13 meetup

**Submission 1:** 
The Elastic Stack
An in-depth discussion of the Elastic (formerly ELK) stack featuring Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Beats, and X-Pack.  We will go through each component and discuss how it can help with DevOps workloads. 

**Submission 2:** 
Logs and Analytics 

The presentation and accompanying demo will illustrate how we take log data, use beats and logstash to ship, parse, and enrich the logs.  Then show how Kibana can be used to visualize the data and build interactive dashboards to drill down into the data.  We will then explore how we can go beyond dashboards and use the capabilities of the Elastic stack to predict future events based on historical data and visualize it with Timelion.  We will then show a Graph exploration of the log data to explore attacks attempted at the website all from the same log data.
